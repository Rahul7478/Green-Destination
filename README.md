🌿 Uncovering Employee Attrition Insights with Power BI! 📉💼
Excited to present my latest Power BI project — a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition trends for Green Destinations, a renowned travel agency! 🌍🧳

🔍 What I Explored:
Leveraging a rich HR dataset containing employee demographics, income, tenure, and attrition status, I built a dynamic dashboard that sheds light on the underlying patterns behind staff turnover.

📊 Key Highlights of the Dashboard:

🔹 Age & Experience Trends – Do younger or more experienced employees leave more? 📈
🔹 Income Distribution – Analyzing how salary impacts attrition 💰
🔹 Department & Job Role Analysis – Which areas are most affected? 🏢
🔹 Education & Gender Distribution – Visualizing trends across demographic groups 🎓⚖️
🔹 Years at Company vs Attrition – Are longer-tenured employees staying? ⏳
🔹 Interactive Slicers – Filter data by gender, department, and education for deeper insights 🎛️

🛠️ Skills & Tools Used:
📌 Power BI – For building interactive dashboards and visuals
🧹 Power Query – For data cleaning and transformation
📊 DAX – To create dynamic measures like attrition %
📈 Visuals Used: Stacked bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, cards, and slicers
